# Butterfield

This project aims to be an ongoing implementation of the Roughtime protocol,
with the aim of being a tool for assisting in validating interoperability,
testing servers and validating behaviours. It's not, by the namesake of the
protocol aiming to have high accuracy or precision with respect to timestamps,
however will try its best not to be deliberately terrible at it either.

Why the name? It's named after
[Butterfield dials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfield_dial), which were
a form of sundial and thus, rough time.
